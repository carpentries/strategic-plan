# The Carpentries Strategic Plan

This repository contains documentation on the progress The Carpentries is making towards its 3-5 year Strategic Plan. It is intended to provide transparency to the Carpentries community.

[The Carpentries Strategic Plan](https://github.com/carpentries/strategic-plan/blob/carpentries-ed/strategic-plan.md),
lays out six broad goals, each with its rationale and underlying objectives, that will serve as touchpoints to guide our future actions. The Strategic Plan provides a general framework for the direction of this organisation for the next 3-5 years. This Strategic Plan speaks to The Carpentries as a whole. Each of the individual Lesson Programs – Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, and Software Carpentry – may also have their own goals and objectives related to their specific programs and curricula.

This repository is organized as follows:
* [issues](https://github.com/carpentries/strategic-plan/issues): information about projects and ongoing work The Carpentries is undertaking related to the strategic plan. Each issue is tagged with one or more labels:
  * __team__ -  identifies which team leads the work (i.e. Business, Community Development, Curriculum, Executive/EC, Infrastructure, Instructor Training, Membership, Workshop Administration)
  * __quarter__ - identifies which quarter the project or ongoing work occurs 
  * __goal__ -  identifies which strategic goal the project or ongoing work aligns with. 
  * __assignee__ - identifies the [Core Team](https://carpentries.org/team/) member who is leading the work

* [project board](https://github.com/carpentries/strategic-plan/projects/1): presents a basic [kanban style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) view of work as follows: __in progress__, __upcoming__, __future work__, and __completed__
