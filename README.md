# The Carpentries Executive Council

This repository contains documentation on processes and meetings for the Carpentries Executive Council (EC), and are intended to provide transparency in leadership to the Carpentries community.

[The Carpentries Bylaws](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html#executive-council),
found in The Carpentries Handbook, describe the composition and main responsibilities of the EC. Current and past members, including which members are officers, can be found in the [Governance section](http://static.carpentries.org/governance/) of the Carpentries website.

If you have a question or concern about EC operations, there are three ways you should feel free to communicate with us:
1. **File an [issue](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/issues) in this repository.** This is appropriate if you would like to solicit additional community feedback on a topic of general interest to the community.
2. **Send us an [email](mailto:carpentries-executive-council@carpentries.org)**. This is appropriate for communicating directly with the Executive Council but not the rest of our community. 
3. **Submit [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScdo7AlYfeQN-z5dnO-p8KVI8t17kQUc1VH-Cvrlga5txIwCA/viewform?usp=sf_link).** This is preferable if you would like confidential communication with the EC, or if you would like to remain anonymous.

Documentation is organized as follows:
* [process](process): information about onboarding/offboarding new EC members, yearly tasks/timeline, and specific details of how responsibilities for members and officers are implemented
* [code-of-conduct-transparency-reports](code-of-conduct-transparency-reports): public releases describing incidents reported to the Code of Conduct Committee
* [minutes](minutes): formally approved minutes from monthly EC meetings
* [year-in-review](year-in-review): descriptions of main tasks accomplished by each year's Executive Council
